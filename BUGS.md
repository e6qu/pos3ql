# Blocked defects

This file records only defects whose repair is prevented by an external blocker
or genuine intractability. Fixable defects must be fixed in the change that
finds them. Planned work and architecture limits belong in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

Reviewed for retained row/byte scans and resumable checkpoint identity coverage,
rollback, eviction, callback cleanup, and bounded capacity on
2026-10-11: no defects meet these inclusion criteria.
Resolved investigations are indexed in [history](docs/history/README.md).

For a new entry, include a reproducer, affected boundary, observed behavior,
and the specific blocker that prevents a fix. Remove it when repaired; preserve
provenance in the implementing change rather than adding a resolved-work journal.
