This plan lists only unfinished work. Current behavior belongs in the
[guides](docs/README.md); historical plans are preserved in the
[history index](docs/history/README.md).

## The destination

- Applications use supported PostgreSQL 18 SQL and clients, with explicit errors
  for anything unsupported.
- Object storage holds the durable copy. A confirmed commit survives loss of the
  server's disk.
- A slow storage request never stalls unrelated connections, and independent
  connections use several CPU cores.
- Memory, disk and concurrency limits are fixed before startup. Shared capacity
  follows demand, and running out gives a named error.
- A failed server is replaced from object storage through a tested procedure
  that reroutes clients.
- Users choose hardware from repeatable measurements against vanilla
  PostgreSQL 18.

One active process publishes to each object-store prefix and keeps commits in
durable order. That order does not require running every read, upload or SQL
statement one at a time.

## Where we are

SQL, transactions in `mvcc` and `locking` modes, PostgreSQL clients, indexes,
logical replication, backup and recovery from object storage work today and are
compared with PostgreSQL 18 in CI. Object-store requests overlap and commits
share uploads. SQL runs on one CPU worker. Many paths already pause during a
storage wait and resume later: reads, cleanup, merges, checkpoints, cursors,
PL/pgSQL and SQL-language functions, and triggers. Writing statements, and any
statement after its first effect, still block that worker on a storage read. No measurement on separate machines has been published.

## Milestones

Each milestone is a coherent piece of work that ships in complete PRs. The order
is the intended sequence. Compatibility work runs alongside the others.

### Pause and resume every query path

**Goal:** a statement waiting for object storage or another connection's lock
gives up the CPU worker and later resumes exactly where it stopped.

**Example:** inserting an order fires a trigger that writes an audit row and
takes an order number. The trigger waits for storage. Meanwhile other clients
run. On resumption the same order keeps the same local values, audit row and
number.

**Done today:** ordered AFTER-trigger work; nested INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE;
trigger frames; PL/pgSQL calls inside `PERFORM`, `SELECT ... INTO`,
declaration initializers and every PL/pgSQL statement's expressions,
including statements with several (`FOR` bounds, `CASE`, `RAISE` arguments
and options, `IF ... ELSIF`, `ASSERT`, `CALL` arguments, dynamic `EXECUTE`
values), which keep finished values across a wait; SQL-language function
bodies, child calls and return checks; domain `CHECK`s on a PL/pgSQL
function's result, which keep the finished result and the check's calls; PL/pgSQL procedures and `DO` blocks,
including nested `CALL`, resuming at the waiting statement after their own
`COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`, with queries yielding on storage reads; SQL cursors executing from retained query state, including row locks
taken per `FETCH` and scrollable cursors that evaluate revisited rows again;
client output that never blocks the worker on a slow reader; large
single-table and generated-series results, and paged portals over them,
resuming row by row across client, storage and lock waits. The
[request path](docs/architecture.md#the-request-path) describes how saved state
is owned.

**Remaining:**

- **Functions:** writes inside a procedure body still read storage
  synchronously, as do PL/pgSQL cursor reads (`OPEN`, `FETCH` and cursor
  `FOR` loops), whose lock waits already park. A top-level `SELECT` that the retained reader cannot hold
  (`DISTINCT` over routine output, grouping sets, groupings whose keys or aggregate inputs call
  routines, subqueries, sorts in object-store mode or over non-volatile
  routine output, joins it would probe through an index) restarts once for
  each first call of a SQL-language routine, so its work grows with the square
  of those calls; single-table, `VALUES` and `generate_series` sources,
  retained nested-loop and hash joins, local-mode sorts (volatile output runs
  after the sort), retained groupings, and cursors ordered by source columns,
  hand each call off on its row. Removing the restart needs those shapes retained (above): the
  general executor cannot run a routine body inside expression evaluation.
- **Write phases:** BEFORE/INSTEAD triggers, source scans, row locks, partitions,
  constraints, transition tables, rules, data-modifying common table
  expressions (CTEs), COPY, replication apply and deferred triggers. Keep the
  original command and rollback boundary. Replace the current explicit rejection
  of row progress in multirow updates with saved progress: a child statement must
  see earlier changed rows before the next row is written, and each operation
  keeps its own transition table and firing order.
- **Results and cursors:** large results resume row by row for `SELECT`
  from one table or builtin set-returning functions with constant arguments,
  or a nested-loop or hash join of up to eight such items and `VALUES` lists
  (inner, cross, `LEFT`, and two-item `RIGHT` and `FULL`),
  with an `ORDER BY` or `DISTINCT ON` sorted in `plan_build_bytes` in local mode or a
  `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, aggregates and plain `DISTINCT` computed there, or a
  `UNION ALL` of such queries, with inlined CTEs, views and simple FROM
  subqueries merged in, including paged portals, forward `FETCH` from `NO SCROLL` cursors and
  `COPY ... TO STDOUT` of such a query or one table. Remaining:
  - More retained shapes, by the
    [retained plan tree design](docs/architecture.md#retained-plan-tree):
    index-probed joins, `RIGHT` and `FULL` joins of more than two items or
    over generator calls, grouping sets,
    subqueries other than the simple FROM subqueries merged into their query
    and uncorrelated scalar, `EXISTS`, `ARRAY` and row subqueries of unsorted,
    ungrouped streams (correlated ones, `IN`/`ANY`/`ALL` lists, subqueries
    under a sort or grouping, grouped or bounded derived tables, and scans of
    CTEs that run once),
    set operations other than `UNION ALL` (and `UNION ALL` under
    `ORDER BY`, in a declared cursor, or with volatile or routine-calling
    expressions), sorts in object-store mode (external runs
    with a run reader per stream; a large ordered `SELECT` there still
    spools, and a paged portal of one buffers in `portal_result_bytes`),
    and more
    set-returning functions than the generator builtins (series, subscripts,
    one-array `unnest`, regex, and the `json`/`jsonb` `_each`,
    `_array_elements` and `_object_keys` families, alone or in `ROWS FROM`):
    function arguments that are not constants, user-defined and other builtin
    set-returning functions, and column definition lists such as
    `jsonb_to_recordset(...) AS t(a int)`.
    Cursors over those shapes run at `DECLARE`: a scrollable cursor ordered by
    an expression that is not a source column returns saved values where
    PostgreSQL evaluates a volatile output list again, and a row-locking cursor
    over a join, or ordered by such an expression, locks its rows at `DECLARE`.
    Cursors over retained joins already read as they fetch; declared cursors
    do not yet use the retained sort.
  - Scrollable cursors whose revisited rows are evaluated again (volatile
    output or filter), ordered scrollable cursors and held cursors still save
    their history in `cursor_bytes`. A scrollable cursor moving back rereads
    its input from the first row; retained position checkpoints would bound
    that reread.
  - Saving a held cursor at commit reads storage synchronously: the fourteen
    callers of the commit path (statement, protocol, procedure and
    replication commits) do not yet accept a wait before the commit is
    staged.

**Done when:**

- Writing statements and statements past their first effect no longer block the
  worker on storage reads; the blocking list in the
  [request path](docs/architecture.md#execution-model) is empty except where
  durable commit order requires it.
- Resumed work keeps its selected definitions, inputs, settings, effective user,
  command visibility, timestamps and deadline. Sequence calls, advisory locks,
  audit writes and delivered rows happen once, across repeated waits.
- A failed save leaves the live call usable. Reused temporary memory cannot
  change saved text, arrays, records or NULL field types. Internal waits do not
  trigger user error handlers. Savepoint boundaries hold.
- Cancellation, timeout, rollback, disconnect and completion release saved
  state. Memory stays inside startup pools, including 4,096-row results inside
  the 4 MiB statement arena.
- Tests with an actually delayed object-store GET show another client making
  progress, with empty caches, both transaction modes, both wire protocols,
  triggers and nested functions. The same SQL gives the same rows, audit writes,
  sequence values, types, errors and rollback as PostgreSQL 18.

### Isolate readers and bound cleanup

**Goal:** a reader finishes with the rows and definitions it selected while
schema changes, commits and maintenance continue; cleanup never removes
anything a reader or backup still needs.

**Example:** a report keeps reading `orders` while another connection renames it
to `sales` and maintenance replaces its saved files. A waiting schema edit never
attaches to a new object that reused the old name.

**Remaining:**

- Catalog reads after listing an object refer to that same object: columns,
  indexes, comments and dependencies (including repeated dependency rows).
  Unfinished edits stay private. Follow PostgreSQL's split between listing an
  old catalog row and resolving a current name: an older report can still list
  `orders` while `to_regclass('sales')` finds the renamed table.
- Keep old rows, indexes and saved files until readers and backups finish, and
  remove them in bounded batches. Files from an unfinished checkpoint stay owned
  until its publication resolves. Durable manifests never name unfinished
  uploads, and switching output producers never cancels another job's files.
- Keep read counters through savepoint rollback and release. A replacement
  table reusing a slot never inherits a retired table's counters.
- Reject corrupt or stale restored state before accepting writes. A lost commit
  reply resolves to all changes or none.

**Done when:** overlapping reads, schema edits, publication and maintenance keep
readers on their selected objects and values, new reads see whole commits, and
existing rollback, savepoint, prepared-transaction, capacity and empty-cache
recovery tests keep passing.

### Measure a first deployment baseline

**Goal:** test the core bet early: commits through object storage give useful
latency and cost compared with PostgreSQL.

**Example:** on two fixed hosts with separate object storage, report typical and
slow commit latency, point-read and scan latency with warm and empty caches, and
object requests and bytes per transaction.

**Work:** record hosts, network and object storage without publishing
credentials. Run the [measurement suite](docs/performance.md) repeatedly against
both PostgreSQL 18 controls: one with the host's resources and one with the same
CPU and memory allowance as pos3ql. Retain revisions, raw results, latency
distributions, CPU/RSS, request counts, bytes and cost inputs in
[benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md).

**Done when:** a dated, reproducible baseline is published. Its results inform
the order of the later milestones.

### Run SQL on several CPU workers

**Goal:** independent connections use several CPU cores. Each connection keeps
its command order, and every confirmed transaction stays recoverable.

**Work:** choose a fixed worker pool before startup. Give each worker its own
temporary execution state and protect shared rows, definitions, locks and
transactions. Preserve database and account identity, fair queues, cancellation,
storage waits and commit order. A global lock that runs statements in turn does
not meet this goal.

**Done when:** read, write and mixed workloads scale with workers, overload
returns explicit errors, and all correctness gates pass with several workers.

### Share fixed capacity by demand

**Goal:** fixed startup pools of memory and disk follow current demand instead
of private per-table reservations.

**Example:** configuring many tables does not reserve row tracking space for each
empty one. If most traffic touches `orders`, it uses the free shared slots. A
long report keeps its selected versions until it finishes.

**Done today:** row metadata, foreground row work, table definitions, index
bindings, analyzed columns and procedural execution state share explicit pools.
[Architecture](docs/architecture.md#memory-and-physical-size) lists them.

**Remaining:**

- Reserve forward progress for commit, rollback, required reads and maintenance;
  reclaim in bounded steps; report pinned capacity and named exhaustion.
  Replacements are reserved before effects. For example, if analyzing `orders`
  cannot reserve statistics space, the previous statistics stay usable.
- Reduce the remaining catalog reservations from measured component costs.
- Decide whether cache files need guaranteed disk reservation, then implement
  and verify it. File length is not reserved disk space.
- Measure 1, 8, 32 and 128 tables at equal explicit capacity in both modes, with
  narrow and wide schemas, retained readers and schema/index replacement. Label
  every counter and unit; separate startup reservations, resident pages, stack
  and TLS. Compare with the
  [historical embedded measurements](https://github.com/e6qu/pos3ql/blob/4054a6d3c79e916728f8e84d84139eae6d86b501/benchmarks/baselines/2026-10-30-embedded-lazy-definitions/README.md)
  only at identical capacities.

**Done when:** total reserved memory is unchanged, capacity is conserved, no
runtime heap growth occurs, release after errors is safe, and the measurement
matrix supports any claimed embedded minimum. The
[resource design](docs/adaptive-resources.md) holds the proposed policies.

### Adapt batching and layout with feedback control

**Goal:** inside fixed limits, pos3ql adjusts batch sizes, admission and future
data layout to the observed workload, using measured feedback control.

**Example:** an isolated lookup starts immediately. Under sustained traffic,
compatible reads and writes share bounded batches. A nightly column report does
not evict every frequently reused lookup block.

**Work:**

- Keep fixed request slots, arenas and disk limits. Adjust active windows,
  lease ownership and batch sizes inside them. Bound queue delay and bytes.
  Protect demand reads, commit publication and required maintenance before
  read-ahead or duplicate requests.
- Compare simple feedback, proportional-integral (PI) and
  proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Each has an explicit
  policy, ceilings, minimum progress, sample interval and count, and maximum
  batch delay and bytes. Clamp changes, filter noisy samples, avoid repeated
  reversals, and stop integral error from accumulating when owned capacity
  cannot be reclaimed (anti-windup). Choose the controller from measurements,
  not by assuming a more elaborate one is better.
- Choose future row or column output, and ranged or whole-object reads, from
  measured column demand, reuse, update rate and rewrite cost. Avoid rewriting
  layout after short bursts.

**Done when:** fixed and adaptive policies are compared at equal resources on
MinIO and SeaweedFS against both PostgreSQL controls, across idle, burst,
sustained and cooling traffic, point and scan mixes, bulk writes, delays,
failures, cancellation, long readers and maintenance pressure. Results include
latency distributions, throughput, requests and bytes, useful prefetch, cache
and pinned usage, fairness and controller settling time. Correctness, durable
order and startup limits hold throughout. The
[resource design](docs/adaptive-resources.md) holds the controller design.

### Close application compatibility gaps

**Goal:** applications that use supported PostgreSQL 18 features work unchanged.

**Work:** audit PostgreSQL 18 built-in functions by signature and executed
behavior; being listed in the catalog is not support. Keep the SQLAlchemy,
Alembic, psycopg2 and other client comparisons passing, and turn every
unsupported case into an explicit error. Known gaps: changing `STRICT`,
`SECURITY` or `SET` of a built-in function, or renaming or moving one, fails
with `0A000` where PostgreSQL changes the catalog entry; a revoked built-in
`EXECUTE` is not checked for the function behind an operator (`1 + 1` after
`REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION int4pl(integer, integer) FROM PUBLIC`);
`DROP ROLE` reports dependent objects without PostgreSQL's `DETAIL` list
(`owner of function lower(text)`); built-in functions have no
`pg_description` text of their own (`obj_description('lower(text)'::regprocedure)`
is NULL where PostgreSQL returns `lowercase`). PL/pgSQL compile errors in a
`DO` body carry no cursor position (`LINE 1: ...` with a caret), though the
same errors in `CREATE FUNCTION` do; a block label before `DECLARE` is
rejected with `0A000`, and a label-qualified loop variable (`<<l>> FOR i IN
1..2 LOOP ... l.i`) fails as an unknown table; exception conditions are
limited to a fixed list of names (`SQLSTATE` codes work for every condition);
trigger functions cannot open cursors (`OPEN`, cursor `FOR` loops) and fail
with `0A000`. An aggregate inside a subquery whose arguments read only an
outer query's columns belongs to that outer query in PostgreSQL (`SELECT
(SELECT max(t.id) FROM u) FROM t` aggregates `t`), but is computed per outer
row here. An uncorrelated subquery runs before the query's first row,
where PostgreSQL runs it at its first use (an initPlan) unless it sits in a
`WHERE` or `HAVING` conjunct that reads no column of the query (a one-time
filter): `SELECT (SELECT 1/x FROM z) FROM empty_table` fails with `22012`
here and returns no rows in PostgreSQL. A SQL function whose earlier
statements are not queries or data changes (`CREATE TEMP TABLE t(a int);
SELECT a FROM t`) has its result converted value by value at the call instead
of being type-checked like PostgreSQL's analysis just before the final
statement runs. Column defaults, CHECK constraints, routine parameter defaults
`RETURN` bodies, index predicates, trigger `WHEN` conditions and rule
conditions are printed in PostgreSQL's analyzed form (`'x'::text`,
`((k >= 1) AND (k <= 5))`), but only for literals, columns, parameters,
operators, `IN`, `LIKE`, `IS NULL`, `CASE`, casts, SQL value functions and
built-in function calls; other expressions (subqueries, user-defined function
calls, `$n` parameters, array constructors, whole-row references and `IS
DISTINCT FROM`) are still printed as stored. `pg_get_viewdef` uses PostgreSQL's
layout, including its wrap column, only for a view
over plain tables joined with `ON` conditions, without `DISTINCT`, `HAVING`,
comma or `USING` joins, subqueries or set operations; other views return their
query text. A `BEGIN ATOMIC` body is printed as written rather than one
deparsed statement per line, and `pg_get_function_sqlbody` returns NULL for
it; rule actions (`DO INSERT ...`) are printed as written, and their pretty
form fails with `0A000`; policy expressions are not deparsed. Errors in a client's query report
PostgreSQL's cursor position (the `P` field that psql shows as `LINE 1:` and a
caret) for syntax errors and for unknown relations, columns, types, functions
and operators, failed constant input and non-boolean conditions, except a
folded or quoted identifier in a statement that waited for typed inputs and a
constant written inside a routine body. `INSERT INTO t (a[1], b) SELECT 1` reports PostgreSQL's
`INSERT has more target columns than expressions` without its position; other
target and expression count errors are positioned. At
`CREATE FUNCTION`, a SQL body's queries are analysed for their relations,
output columns, functions and types, and a data-changing statement only for
its target relation, so an unknown column in an `UPDATE ... SET` list is
found when the function runs. An error raised while PostgreSQL inlines a SQL function's body
(`SQL function "f" during inlining`) has no context line. Under
`#variable_conflict use_variable` a variable that is also a column fails with
`0A000`: aggregate inputs and grouping keys bind names to columns before the
variable could win. PostgreSQL fixes a function's `plpgsql.variable_conflict`
when its creating session validates it at `CREATE FUNCTION`; pos3ql reads it
at the backend's first call. A function-qualified parameter (`f.a` in function `f`)
fails as a missing FROM-clause entry, as does a subquery in FROM that reads a
column of an enclosing query (`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT 10 / t.x) s)`,
which PostgreSQL evaluates per outer row), and PL/pgSQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and
`DELETE ... RETURNING ... INTO` fail with a syntax error at `INTO`. A constant compared
with a column inside a subquery (`SELECT (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a = 'q')`) is
checked only when a row is compared, so an empty table returns NULL where
PostgreSQL rejects `'q'`; the outer query's conditions, output list and joins
and an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` condition are checked before any row is read. Assignment
coercion is not analysed: a value of a type without an assignment cast to its
target converts when the row is written, so `UPDATE t SET m[1] = 'x'::text`
on an empty table succeeds and `INSERT INTO t (m[1:2]) SELECT '{1,2}' UNION
ALL SELECT '{3,4}'` stores the text where PostgreSQL reports `42804`
(`subscripted assignment to "m" requires type integer[] but expression is of
type text`); fixing it needs PostgreSQL's assignment-cast rules for every
target type.
Checks PostgreSQL makes in parse analysis or execution (type modifiers, COPY
options, storage parameters, sequence, database and large-object values,
SQL/JSON result types) are reported when the statement would run. In a
`SELECT`, an unknown relation, a modifier's unknown type and an output column
written before the failing modifier are reported first, as PostgreSQL's
analysis order finds them; in other statements the modifier error comes first.
COPY to or from a server file or program,
`COPY ... FREEZE`, a COPY `ENCODING` other than UTF8 and `JSON_QUERY ...
RETURNING` a non-JSON, non-string type are rejected with `0A000`.
A SQL-language procedure called from a trigger fired inside a write (a BEFORE
row trigger, a deferred constraint trigger at `COMMIT`) runs queries, data
changes and nested `CALL`, but rejects DDL and other utility statements with
`0A000` because that trigger runs without the engine's utility executor.
Relation row types: values and columns of a
view's row type, and dropping a relation through `DROP SCHEMA`, `DROP
MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `DROP FOREIGN TABLE ... CASCADE` while another table's
column uses its row type, fail with `0A000`; a `DROP TABLE ... CASCADE` that
reaches both columns and routines, or names several tables, reports one notice
per table or dependency kind where PostgreSQL reports one for the statement, and a routine's dependency on a row type is described as depending on the
table. Values and columns of a view's row type need the view's column types,
which pos3ql derives from the view's query on each use instead of storing them
as PostgreSQL's `pg_attribute` rows do. In a SQL-language function, `o.note`
for a composite parameter `o` fails with `42P01` (`(o).note` works): the
reference must fall back from a column to the parameter's field in every typing
pass, as PostgreSQL's `sql_fn_post_column_ref` does. The
[compatibility guide](docs/postgresql-18-compatibility.md) records the current
surface.

**Done when:** every PostgreSQL 18 built-in is either verified against
PostgreSQL or rejected explicitly, and the client suites pass on every native
target.

### Qualify production deployment

**Goal:** a user can choose hardware and trust failover from published evidence.

**Work:** extend the baseline to useful data sizes, joins, large catalogs,
maintenance, several workers, logical replicas, delays, recovery and multi-host
failover with real client routing. Run each scenario repeatedly on pinned
hardware with independent object storage and both PostgreSQL controls.

**Done when:** published measurements support stated sizes, transaction rates,
bandwidth and failover times. Calculated estimates and theoretical address
limits do not count as evidence.

## Working rules

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the engineering and change rules and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) holds the verification gates. The roadmap is
finished only when every milestone's "done when" is demonstrated.
